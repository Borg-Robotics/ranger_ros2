  ros__parameters:
    # Maximum linear velocity (m/s)
    # This is the velocity when joystick is at full forward/backward (+1 or -1)
    max_linear_vel: 0.5
    
    # Maximum angular velocity (rad/s)
    # This is the rotation speed when joystick is at full left/right (+1 or -1)
    max_angular_vel: 0.3
    
    # Dead band threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
    # Joystick values below this threshold will be treated as zero
    # Helps prevent drift and accidental movements
    dead_band: 0.05
    
    # Publishing rate (Hz)
    # How often to publish cmd_vel messages
    # Higher rates provide smoother control but use more CPU
    publish_rate: 20.0
    
    # Future parameters for special motions (left controller)
    # Uncomment and adjust as needed when implementing special motions
    
    # enable_crab_walk: true
    # crab_walk_speed: 0.3
    
    # enable_in_place_rotation: true
    # in_place_rotation_speed: 0.8
